        <li><strong>Vague steps:</strong> write actions a new tester can follow.</li>

        <li><strong>No test data:</strong> add real and boundary values.</li>
        <li><strong>Missing traceability:</strong> always link to a story or requirement ID.</li>
        <li><strong>Unmaintained suites:</strong> review and retire duplicates every release.</li>

            title: "QA Tips that Raise Quality",
            content: `<ul>
        <li><strong>Start with smoke coverage:</strong> a small set that runs on every build.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a checklist for consistency:</strong> preconditions, data, steps, expected result, and evidence.</li>
        <li><strong>Pair on first runs:</strong> author and reviewer execute once to validate clarity.</li>
        <li><strong>Track status with a matrix:</strong> map cases to requirements and show pass or fail per release.</li>
        <li><strong>Promote high value cases to automation:</strong> focus on stable critical paths like login and checkout.</li>
      </ul>`,

    conclusion: `<p>Great test cases are short, clear, and repeatable. Use the template, model your writing on the good examples, and link every case to a requirement so leaders can see coverage at a glance. With these habits, CDPL learners and partner teams can collaborate smoothly and ship reliable features.</p>`,
