            title: "1) Foundation: ICP, Goals & North Star Metrics",
            content: `<p>Start with a <strong>tight Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)</strong> and quantifiable goals. Marketing that “wins everywhere” wins nowhere.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ICP Canvas:</strong> industry, firmographics (size, revenue), roles, pains, desired outcomes, buying triggers, objections, and channels they trust.</li>
        <li><strong>North Star:</strong> Marketing Qualified Pipeline (MQP) or Sales Qualified Opportunities (SQO), supported by <em>leading indicators</em> (SQL rate, demo requests, CAC, LTV:CAC, payback).</li>
        <li><strong>Framework:</strong> Map touchpoints with <strong>STDC</strong> (See–Think–Do–Care) to align content and offers to intent.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Output:</strong> one-sentence ICP, two priority segments, target KPIs (e.g., +40% qualified organic sessions, +25% demo rate, sub-3-month payback).</p>`

            title: "2) Keyword & Topic Research for Topical Authority (SEO 2025)",
            content: `<p>Ranking in 2025 is about <strong>topical authority</strong>, not one-off keywords. Build <em>clusters</em> that cover a problem space comprehensively.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Seed topics & competitors:</strong> Pull terms from ICP interviews, CRM notes, and competitor pages.</li>
        <li><strong>Cluster model:</strong> Group by search intent (informational, commercial, transactional) and funnel stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Pillars & spokes:</strong> Create a <em>pillar page</em> (3,000–5,000 words) + 10–20 <em>supporting articles</em> each targeting a subtopic.</li>
        <li><strong>Programmatic SEO:</strong> Identify templated pages (e.g., “tool vs tool”, “best X for Y”, “pricing for X in {city}”).</li>
        <li><strong>Prioritize by business value:</strong> Volume is useless without intent. Score by <em>revenue potential × ranking difficulty × topical gap</em>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>High-ranking keyword examples</strong> to bake into titles/H1s naturally: <em>digital marketing strategy 2025, seo strategy 2025, content marketing plan, programmatic seo, google ads strategy, conversion rate optimization, email marketing automation, ga4 attribution, first-party data strategy</em>.</p>`

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hygiene (Help):</strong> evergreen “how to” and “best practices” articles (intent: Think/Do). Publish 2–3/week.</li>
        <li><strong>Hub:</strong> opinion pieces, benchmarks, templates (monthly). Great for <em>newsletter growth</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Hero:</strong> big swings—data reports, tools, calculators, webinars—quarterly for PR/backlinks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>On-page SEO checklist:</strong> single H1 with primary keyword, semantic subheads (H2–H3), internal links to pillar/spokes, FAQ schema, descriptive alt text, and clear CTAs aligned to funnel stage (demo, template download, calculator).</p>`

            title: "4) Technical SEO & Performance for Revenue",
            content: `<p>Traffic that can’t convert—or pages that don’t get indexed—waste money. Prioritize <strong>crawlability</strong>, <strong>indexation</strong>, and <strong>Core Web Vitals</strong>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Index hygiene:</strong> XML sitemaps by type, clean robots rules, canonical consistency (no parameter duplication), hreflang for locales.</li>
        <li><strong>Speed:</strong> serve next-gen images (AVIF/WEBP), lazy-load below the fold, prefetch routes, and strip render-blocking JS/CSS.</li>
        <li><strong>Structured Data:</strong> Article, FAQ, HowTo, Product, Organization; keep JSON-LD in the initial HTML.</li>
        <li><strong>UX signals:</strong> improve <em>LCP, INP, CLS</em> with image dimensions, font preloads, and minimal third-party bloat.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Technical SEO compounds ranking gains and meaningfully boosts conversion by cutting friction.</p>`

            content: `<p>Your <strong>PPC strategy</strong> should separate <em>demand capture</em> (high intent) from <em>demand creation</em> (problem/solution education).</p>
      <h3>Demand Capture (bottom-funnel)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Search:</strong> exact and phrase for “best X software”, “X pricing”, “X alternatives”, “X vs Y”.</li>
        <li><strong>Shopping/PMAX (ecom):</strong> feed hygiene, exclusion lists, branded split to protect margins.</li>
        <li><strong>Remarketing:</strong> cart/lead abandoners with dynamic content and short windows.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Demand Creation (mid/top-funnel)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Video/YouTube & Paid Social:</strong> target ICP problem narratives; drive to <em>middle-funnel</em> assets (calculators, ROI tools, templates).</li>
        <li><strong>LinkedIn (B2B):</strong> job titles + firmographics; rotate creative every 14–21 days; optimize to <em>quality lead rate</em>, not CTR.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Bidding & budgets:</strong> split budgets by intent; use tCPA/tROAS on mature campaigns; for new offers, start with Maximize Conversions + value rules. Always sync <em>offline conversions</em> (qualified pipeline) to ad platforms.</p>`

        <li><strong>Activation:</strong> onboarding checklist, quick wins, habit loops, usage nudges.</li>
        <li><strong>Expansion:</strong> cross-sell/upsell based on behavior, QBR prompts (B2B), replenishment (ecom).</li>
        <li><strong>Win-back:</strong> 30/60/90-day re-engagement with new value props.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Best practices:</strong> segment by lifecycle stage and intent; personalize by job role; use <em>behavioral</em> triggers (viewed pricing, added to cart, visited docs). Track revenue per send, not just open/clicks.</p>`

        <li><strong>Offline conversion import:</strong> push qualified pipeline/SQOs back to Google/Meta to train bidding models on <em>real value</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Attribution:</strong> triangulate with GA4 data-driven attribution, platform models, and a simple MMM/Bayesian baseline for budget planning.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent & governance:</strong> CMP with clear tagging rules; server-side tagging to stabilize data quality.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Dashboards:</strong> one executive view (revenue, CAC, LTV:CAC, payback), one marketing ops view (channel ROAS, CPA, pipeline by source), and a product view (activation, retention).</p>`
