  introduction: `<p>Manual testing validates software by executing actions as a user would and observing actual results. For Cinute Digital Pvt Ltd (CDPL) learners and partner teams, strong manual testing skills improve product quality, clarify requirements, and reduce costly rework.</p>
  
  <p>This guide explains the differences between <em>test scenarios</em>, <em>test cases</em>, and <em>test suites</em>, then shows how to design each one with clear steps, data, and expected results. You will also learn coverage tracking, prioritization, and reporting practices trusted by modern teams.</p>`,

        <li><strong>Test Scenario:</strong> a user goal or feature level behavior to validate, for example "user checks out with a saved address". Scenarios group related flows.</li>
        <li><strong>Test Case:</strong> a repeatable procedure with preconditions, steps, test data, and expected results for a single outcome.</li>
        <li><strong>Test Suite:</strong> an organized collection of cases that target a scope such as smoke, regression, or module level coverage.</li>
        <li><strong>Coverage and Traceability:</strong> map cases to requirements and risks to ensure important behavior is tested.</li>

Expected Result:
  - Payment succeeds
  - Order ID is displayed

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Smoke:</strong> runs in minutes on every build to catch obvious failures.</li>
        <li><strong>Regression:</strong> deeper coverage before release gates. Group by module.</li>
        <li><strong>Exploratory:</strong> charter based, time boxed sessions that discover unknown risks.</li>
        <li><strong>UAT:</strong> business acceptance with production like data and workflows.</li>

        <li>No maintenance. Review and retire duplicates every release.</li>
        <li>Only happy paths. Add negative and boundary tests.</li>
        <li>Untracked coverage. Always link cases to requirements and risks.</li>

        <li>Test management: tools that support suites, traceability, and CI exports.</li>
        <li>Team stack: ticketing for defects, dashboards for quality KPIs, and storage for evidence.</li>

      title: "Checklist for CDPL Learners",

        <li>Write scenario statements for each acceptance criterion.</li>
        <li>Create cases with clear steps, data, and results.</li>
        <li>Group cases into smoke and regression suites.</li>
        <li>Maintain a traceability matrix and update status on every run.</li>
        <li>Report bugs with full context and link to the failing case.</li>
      </ul>`,

  conclusion: `<p>Manual testing strengthens product quality when scenarios are meaningful, cases are precise, and suites are organized around risk and release flow. Start with smoke coverage, grow a focused regression suite, and keep traceability visible to the whole team. With these habits, learners and partner teams at CDPL can ship confidently while learning industry grade QA skills.</p>`,
