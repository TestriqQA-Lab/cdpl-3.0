We didn’t just learn theory, we ran focused exploratory sessions with charters, mapped risks, and compared coverage heuristics. I built API and UI suites that ran on CI for every PR, learned to tame flakiness with better waits/selectors, and used traces to debug fast. Weekly reviews pushed me to justify priorities and document crisp repro steps. By demo day I had a clean repo, a small dashboard for suite health, and the confidence to walk engineers through my approach end-to-end. We practiced with structured reviews, shipped capstones, and wrote docs like in a real team. I came out with a portfolio piece, confident interviews, and habits I still use daily.", span: "big", feature: true },
