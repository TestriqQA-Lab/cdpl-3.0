/**
 * City-page tiering — the single source of truth for which of the 765
 * programmatic city pages Google is allowed to index.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * `src/types/courseData.ts` defines 765 city pages across 260 localities, six
 * course families each. 476 of them are Maharashtra, and after Mumbai, Pune and
 * Nagpur every remaining Maharashtra entry is a Mumbai local-train station
 * (CSMT, Dadar, Byculla, Masjid, Grant Road, Charni Road, Matunga, Sion …).
 * A further 22 target UAE desert towns (Liwa Oasis, Ghayathi, Masafi) while no
 * Dubai / Abu Dhabi / Sharjah page exists at all.
 *
 * The cost is measurable. For "data science course in mumbai" — 1,212
 * impressions and ZERO clicks over six months — 96 URLs on this site carry both
 * "Data Science" and "Mumbai" in their <title>, all self-canonical and all
 * indexed. Google has to pick one, link equity splits 96 ways, and none of them
 * accumulates enough to reach page one. Every extra city page makes the Mumbai
 * page weaker, not stronger.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES
 * --------------
 * Tier 1 cities stay indexable. Everything else is served with `noindex`,
 * which removes it from search results and stops the cannibalisation, while
 * leaving the page reachable for anyone with a direct link.
 *
 * NOTE ON CRAWLING: `noindex` does NOT stop Googlebot crawling — it must fetch
 * the page to see the directive. Crawl frequency decays over time but never
 * reaches zero. Do NOT also disallow these paths in robots.txt: a blocked page
 * cannot be re-crawled, so Google would never see the noindex and pages already
 * in the index would stay there. Phase 2 (301 redirects) is what actually
 * reclaims crawl budget and transfers link equity into the surviving pages.
 */

/**
 * Cities whose pages remain indexable.
 *
 * Chosen from measured GSC demand, not intuition. Six-month impressions on
 * city-qualified course queries: Mumbai 1,212 + 552 + 348 …, Pune 706 + 424,
 * Chennai 559 + 348 + 259, Kolkata 239 + 218 + 206, Hyderabad 257 + 253.
 *
 * Each of these must earn its place with genuinely city-specific content —
 * `localJobMarketInsight`, `localSalaryInsight` and `localizedFaqs` on the
 * corresponding `courseData` records. A Tier 1 page without those is simply a
 * better-targeted thin page and will not rank either.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — only Mira Road (Mumbai) is a physical CDPL campus. Pages for the
 * other cities describe online / live-online delivery and must NOT imply a
 * local centre, carry a local street address, or emit `LocalBusiness` schema.
