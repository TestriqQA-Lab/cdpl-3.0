/**
 * Curated live-job listings.
 *
 * EMPTY BY DESIGN — do not repopulate from the old data.
 *
 * This array previously held 98 postings covering ~90 employers: Deloitte,
 * Wipro, Capgemini, Accenture, Cognizant, P&G, BNP Paribas, IDFC FIRST Bank,
 * General Mills, Jio, L&T and dozens of smaller firms. CDPL recruits for none
 * of them, and had no written authorisation to syndicate their vacancies. Every
 * one of those postings emitted JobPosting structured data naming the employer,
 * which is both a Google job-posting policy breach and a brand exposure — see
 * the fix in `buildLiveJobPostingSchema` (src/lib/liveJobs.ts).
 *
 * Removing them changes nothing at runtime. The newest expiry in the old data
 * was 2025-12-17, so `isJobOpen()` already filtered all 98 out; the array had
 * been dead weight since that filter shipped. Live jobs now come from Sanity,
 * where every one of these postings has also been deactivated.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ARRAY IS FOR: an outage snapshot. `getLiveJobs()` falls back to it
 * only when the Sanity request THROWS, so the listing does not go blank during
 * a CMS hiccup. An empty snapshot is the honest state while there are no open
 * postings.
 *
 * IF YOU ADD ENTRIES BACK, each one must satisfy all three:
 *   1. CDPL is the employer, OR holds written authorisation from the named
 *      employer to publish their vacancy.
 *   2. `validThrough` (or `eventDate`) is a real, future apply-by date. There
 *      is no default — a posting without one is treated as closed.
 *   3. `company` is the ACTUAL hiring organisation, never a placeholder.
